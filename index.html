                    This can be akin to more like a journal entry. It is just crazy to me how well copilot is predicting what I want to write. 
                    However, if something is going to be labled as a "<em>journal entry</em>" to me, that means I want to write it word for word myself. It should have <strong>my</strong> voice, not the AI's.
                    I went throught the first real module on html today and learned the very very basics. I am trying to use all of the things I learn in this project here to both inspire and
                    reinforce my learning. I'm curious to see how it will grow as I go, but I want to keep the rule that I must build it, from the ground up, <strong>myself</strong>.
                    Maybe I should take snapshots of my progress! That way I don't forget where I started ya know?</p>

                    Went through another lesson that taught a bit more about linking pages to each other as well as how to properly format my code. As well as how to comment things. Pretty easy lesson today!
                    I separated out the A24 movie page into it's own page. I think I'll keep my learning log here for now.</p>

                    Today I learned about tables and how to make them. I also learned about semantic code and how to make my code more readable. I went back through a lot of my code and added
                    things like headers, main, footers, articles, sections, ect to divide out the parts into the correct buckets. I think my code looks quite a bit more organized now. Thus I have 
                    finished with the html section of the codecademy course. I feel like I have a nice sprout of a little personal webiste here. I'm excited to see how it goes. I have to make sure 
                    to keep it at least some what managable and not add too much stuff lol. html was honestly very very easy as I expected. I'm guessing things won't get too hard until javascript 
                    gets involved. I added the Dream schedule page and the Work knowledge page today. I added some notes from a webinar into the work knowledge page. Maybe this can become a pretty 
                    useful tool for myself? We shall see.</p>

                    Today I learned about how to do some basic CSS styling and how to properly link the stylesheet to my main html document. It's pretty simple so far. I wish I had a bit more time
                    to mess around on my own website and get it looking a bit nicer. But for now I've changed a bunch of fonts and sizes and many things to purple on this main page here. It's already 
                    pretty late so I should probably head home. I still need to put into practice the class and id stuff and make sure I used all the stuff I learned. Will work on the site more tomorrow.</p>

                    Today I learned a little more about different things I can use in the css style sheet, and mainly spent some time sprucing up my site and making it look a little nicer. I added a basic background 
                    image and put a bunch of boarders on things. It's starting to look like an acceptable site and not just a text page. I also made the navigation buttons look like buttons which 
                    change color when you hover over them which is fun.</p>

                    I've been bad about keeping up this learning journal lolol. I had to take a break from this project for a few weeks because some work ramped up but I've been back at it starting this week. 
                    I've finished the html and the css portion of the learning track and decided to take a crack at using copilot to do some vibe coding along side this too. I've added another link at the 
                    top of my website that links to "copilot's" webiste. Following this link will take you to a website that is fully created by AI. I'm not allowed to code anything on that side myself and must 
                    use the AI to get it to do what I want. I was pretty impressed with it's capabilities not going to lie, but it was also comforting to see how doing this couse alongside has added a lot of 
                    value to my understand of what's going on. I feel much more effective at using the AI because I have the basic understanding of what it's doing. I can catch it in the few times that it does slip 
                    up and can better prompt it to do what I want. I feel a little silly that it was able to make 
                    it's website look so much better than mine. I like my website a lot but it still looks very amateurish and honestly is still very clunky. Getting the banner to stick to the top of the page 
                    was pretty difficult lol. I think I'll probably steal some of the ideas that copilot uses. I can use the code it creates as reference, but everything on "my" side of the website will be made 
                    with my own two hands damn it. Even if it looks worse. </p>

                    After some thinking, I think it would be smart to maybe shift my learning now that I have the basics for hosting my own webpage. I'm going to work on some IT certifications for job security. 
                    As much as I've been loving learning the front end stuff it's hard to tell how far it would actually get me in my career. I would like to come back and learn things like javascript and react 
                    once I build some skills in some more important areas. I mainly wanted to be able to have a site where I can store thoughts and show off my projects, and I think I can do that without completing 
                    the entire front end track. I was able to do my first git commits and such today! Very exciting. I will now be able to work on this wherever I have a computer.</p>
