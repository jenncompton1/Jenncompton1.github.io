                <h3>Bad Bunny: DeBi TiRAR MaS FOToS</h3>
                <article>
                <p>Enjoyed this album more than I thought I would. Makes me want to go back to bachata classes. 
                    Not sure I will listen to it again as it isn't really my style, but I honestly wouldn't mind hearing 
                    it again.<br>

                <h3>Justin Beiber: SWAG</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Still really not my kind of music T-T. Not bad but not finding it particularily interesting. 
                        I just find this kind of music a little boring I guess. And while the vocal style isn't bad, 
                        it really isn't my favorite personally. Lmao there's some interesting interludes in here of Justin 
                        talking to someone and like being told he has a black soul. It's a little silly but it does bring a 
                        feeling of authenticity to the album.<br>

                <h3>Sabrina Carpenter: Man's best friend</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>I have a lot of complicated feelings about this one. So far the music is my favorite, 
                        but the album title and art makes me pretty uncomfortable. It feels kind of icky. Actually ended up stealing 
                        a couple songs from this album and really wouldn't mind listening to it again. Just whyyy did she have 
                        to make the album cover and title like that. Interesting that there's some country influence in this.<br>

                <article>
                    <p>I don't remember this very well I need to listen to it again.<br>
