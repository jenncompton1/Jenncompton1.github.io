                <h4>Key Hardware Components</h4>
                <p><strong>Motherboard</strong>: Facilitates communication between all components. Houses CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots, and storage connectors. 
                    several different types (ATX, MicroATX, Mini-ITX). Must match CPU socket and RAM type. You would usually choose your motherboard based on the 
                    number of PCIe slots.<br>
                    <strong>CPU</strong>: Central Processing Unit, the brain of the computer. Executes instructions from software and performs calculations. Key specs include "speed" 
                    (GHz), number of cores and threads, cores are processing info, threads is the incoming data. cache memory is a temporary memory holder. You need to ensure 
                    that the CPU is compatible with the motherboard socket type.<br>
                    <strong>RAM</strong>: Random Access Memory, temporary storage for data and instructions for active applications. Fast but volatile, thus the memory is ereased 
                    after the computer is shut off. There are many different types (DIMM, SODIMM, DDR, ECC, non-ECC). Must match motherboard specs. More RAM means more multitasking. 
                    It's not speeding up your system, it is allowing it to run at maximum speed.<br>
                    <strong>Storage Devices</strong>: HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) use spinning disks to read/write data, are slower but offer larger capacities at lower costs. 
                    SSDs (Solid State Drives) use flash memory, are faster, more durable, but more expensive. NVMe (non volatile memory) SSDs are high speed storage directly connected to the motherboard. 
                    NVMe is a protocal to directly access the data. very fast but more expensive and not as high in capacity. <br>
                    <strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</strong>: Converts AC power from outlet to DC power for computer components. Provides various voltage rails (12V, 5V, 3.3V).<br>
                    <strong>Cooling Systems</strong>: Air cooling (Fans), liquid cooling, thermal paste.<br>
                    <strong>Expansion Cards</strong>: GPU (Graphics processing unit), NIC (Network interface card), Sound cards. All of these are optional but usually these 
                    capabilities are built into the system anyway. You can often upgrade these components or add extras.<br>
                    <strong>Peripherals</strong>: monitors, keyboards, mice, printers, external storage, etc. Input/ouput devices for user interaction and functionality.<br>
                </p>

                <h4>Key Laptop Components</h4>
                <p>Pretty similar to the normal key hardware components. In laptops however, they have a battery. The motherboards and CPU need to be a more compact design, and most of 
                    the other components are directly integrated. They are also often designed for better efficientcy because of the battery life. Intel COre (i3, i5, i7, i9) and AMD Ryzen (3, 5, 7, 9) 
                    are the most common CPU series for laptops. These may be soldered directly onto the motherboard. For RAM SODIMM is commonly used, configured as single channel vs dual 
                    for better preformance. <br>
                    Laptops typically have, LCD, IPS, or OLED screens.
