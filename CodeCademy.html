                <h4>Key Hardware Components</h4>
                <p><strong>Motherboard</strong>: Facilitates communication between all components. Houses CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots, and storage connectors. 
                    several different types (ATX, MicroATX, Mini-ITX). Must match CPU socket and RAM type. You would usually choose your motherboard based on the 
                    number of PCIe slots.<br>
                    <strong>CPU</strong>: Central Processing Unit, the brain of the computer. Executes instructions from software and performs calculations. Key specs include "speed" 
                    (GHz), number of cores and threads, cores are processing info, threads is the incoming data. cache memory is a temporary memory holder. You need to ensure 
                    that the CPU is compatible with the motherboard socket type.<br>
                    <strong>RAM</strong>: Random Access Memory, temporary storage for data and instructions for active applications. Fast but volatile, thus the memory is ereased 
                    after the computer is shut off. There are many different types (DIMM, SODIMM, DDR, ECC, non-ECC). Must match motherboard specs. More RAM means more multitasking. 
                    It's not speeding up your system, it is allowing it to run at maximum speed.<br>
                    <strong>Storage Devices</strong>: HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) use spinning disks to read/write data, are slower but offer larger capacities at lower costs. 
                    SSDs (Solid State Drives) use flash memory, are faster, more durable, but more expensive. NVMe (non volatile memory) SSDs are high speed storage directly connected to the motherboard. 
                    NVMe is a protocal to directly access the data. very fast but more expensive and not as high in capacity. <br>
                    <strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</strong>: Converts AC power from outlet to DC power for computer components. Provides various voltage rails (12V, 5V, 3.3V).<br>
                    <strong>Cooling Systems</strong>: Air cooling (Fans), liquid cooling, thermal paste.<br>
                    <strong>Expansion Cards</strong>: GPU (Graphics processing unit), NIC (Network interface card), Sound cards. All of these are optional but usually these 
                    capabilities are built into the system anyway. You can often upgrade these components or add extras.<br>
                    <strong>Peripherals</strong>: monitors, keyboards, mice, printers, external storage, etc. Input/ouput devices for user interaction and functionality.<br>
                </p>

                <h4>Key Laptop Components</h4>
                <p>Pretty similar to the normal key hardware components. In laptops however, they have a battery. The motherboards and CPU need to be a more compact design, and most of 
                    the other components are directly integrated. They are also often designed for better efficientcy because of the battery life. Intel COre (i3, i5, i7, i9) and AMD Ryzen (3, 5, 7, 9) 
                    are the most common CPU series for laptops. These may be soldered directly onto the motherboard. For RAM SODIMM is commonly used, configured as single channel vs dual 
                    for better preformance. <br>
                    Laptops typically have, LCD, IPS, or OLED screens. 
                </p>

                <h4>HDDs vs SSDs and how to replace them</h4>
                <p>SSD's don't have any moving parts thus they are faster and have a longer lifespan. They also have better power efficiency, and quiet. HDD use cases include 
                    backups, bulk storage, archiving. They are commonly used in desktop computers and servers that require larger capacities. SSD's are more expensive. Sounds like 
                    SSD's are generally better and thus cost more.<br>
                    To replace things: often times the interfaces will be the same which makes things very easy. Reasons you might want to do this is to upgrade, or replace a faulty 
                    drive, or you might need more storage capacity. To prep for replacement, back up data, check drive compatibility, and gather tools. 
                    Here are the steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Power off computer and unplug</li>
                    <li>Open the case</li>
                    <li>Locate the storage drive</li>
                    <li>Unscrew and disconnect cables from the drive</li>
                    <li>Align the drive in the bay and secure it with screws</li>
                    <li>Reconnect cables</li>
                    <li>Close the case and power on the computer</li>
                    <li>Enter the computers BIOS/UEFI</li>
                    <li>Partition and format the drive</li>
                    <li>Restore or reinstall OS</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Some troubleshooting issues</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drive not detected, This could be due to a physical failure of connection. Or the drive type might not be compatible with the system, or a config error set in the 
                        BIOS/UEFI
                    </li>
                    <li>Boot issues, Could be due to a physical problem, but it might also be a boot sequence issue. Any reconfig might have place the hard drive in the wrong order. This can be
                         configured in the BIOS.
                    </li>
                    <li>Slow performance, look for updates or do a "trim" command</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Best practices for SSD Longevity. Enable the TRIM command. This enables the OS to check what data in the drive is no longer in use and delete it. Usually enabled by default. 
                    To verify if it is on. use command >>fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify<< If it returns a 0 then it is enabled. Check for firmware updates. Monitor the drive health. In 
                    Windows use diskutility. avoid filling up the drive. Disable defragmentation for SSDs. Defragmentation is not needed for SSDs and can reduce their lifespan.
                </p>

                <h4>Battery health</h4>
                <p>Laptop batteries have charge cycles that degrade over time. There are Lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries. LiPo's are more common cause the size is a little more adaptable. 
                    Signs of battery degradation are pretty obvious. Shorter battery life, overheating and swelling, Sudden shutdown or failure. On windows you can do the command: 
                    >>powercfg /batteryreport<< to get a battery report. This will give you an html file report about the battery health in the home directory. On Mac, you can go to about this mac > 
                    system report > power section. There are also third party tools. <br>
                    Factors taht affect the battery life are high brightness levels and background processes. Frequent full charge/discharges. And exposure to heat. <br>
                    Best practices for battery preservation: Keep charge levels between 20 - 80 percent. Reduce background apps and adjust power settings. <br>
                    It's time to replace when the health falls below 50% original capacity, if the cycle count exceeds the recommendation, or if the laptop is shutting down unexpectedly.<br>
                    Here are steps for replacing a laptop battery:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Verify compatibility</li>
                        <li>Perform safe battery removal</li>
                        <li>Install the new battery</li>
                        <li>Battery calibration (fully charge, discharge to 10%, then recharge)</li>
                        <li>Check system power settings</li>
                        <li>Continue to monitor it's health</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Displays and Antennas</h4>
                <p>In a something like a mobile phone the screen is part of the mobile device. This can make it a huge pain to fix. In laptops the hinges can have a big impact on the health and 
                    longevity of the display. Touch integration is also a common feature and thus a complication. Key factors for display quality are resolution, refresh rate, brightness and contrast. 
                    When choosing a display, sometimes you need something a bit better for creative work or gaming. <br>
                    Common issues, Dim screen, unresponsive touchscreen, dead pixels, lines, flickering screen, or color distortion. Sometimes these are from settings, sometimes they are from hardware 
                    problems. You may need to update the driver for the screen to get the touchscreen to work. If there is a dead pixel, the screen itself might be damage. The lines might be an issue 
                    with the GPU or capble connections for a laptop. Flickering screens could be from loose cable or inverter issue. Color distortion could be cause by a faulty display connection. <br>
                    Antennas are for Wi-Fi, bluetooth, or Cellular. These allow you to connect to the internet or other devices. <br>
                    Common issues could be from outside the device like a week signal or bad connection. The antenna in a laptop is often built into the screen around the outside edge. Bluetooth can usually 
                    only reach 30 ft. Cell problems might be related to the SIM card or roaming settings. <br>
                    Best practices for both: Avoid excessive pressure on screen, regulary clean, adjust or verify brightness settings, Keep device firmware updated, avoid obstructions that may block signals 
                    and regularly check and secure internal antenna connections.
                </p>

                <h4>Display Types</h4>
                <p>Laptop displays: They are integrated in nature, Hinges and mobility affect the device's lifespan, Power managment features, and some have touchscreens. <br>
                    Display form factors: Clamshell laptops are the typical kind, 2-in-1 convertibles are able to fold into a tablet, detachable tablets have detachable screens. <br>
                    Display panel types: Twisted nematic is an LCD type of display which is fast but not great color accuracy, In-Plan switching (IPS) has better color and viewing angles, Organic Light-emitting diode (OLED) 
                    this is the most common, has true blacks and high contrast and is energy efficent. <br>
                    Common Display Resolution: 720p (1280 x 720) (high def), 1080p (1920 x 1080) (Full HD), 4K (3840 x 2160) (Ultra High Def). <br>
                    Common Refresh Rates: 60Hz (gerenal use), 120Hz & 144Hz (better for gamming and motion heavy), 240 Hz (high end gaming and professional use) <br>
                    Types of Touch screens: Capacitive which is in modern laptops, Resistive which is used in industrial devices and require pressure, and Active digitizer panel which are in professional tablets which support 
                    precision styluses. <br>
                    Optimizing Display Longevity: Avoid excessive pressure on screen, clean regularly, adjust brightness settings to prevent OLED burn-in, store laptops in protective cases when traveling. <br>
                </p>

                <p>Things like microphones, webcams, speakers, and wi-fi bluetooth modules. <br>
                    Webcams: think about resolution, frame rate (30fps vs 60fps), and privacy shutter. <br>
                    Microphones: consider omnidirectional vs unidirectional, noise cancelling or beamforming <br>
                    Speakers: Usually small, sometimes that limits bass output, the output might include enhancments like DTS or Dolby Atmos, AI noise suppression. <br>
                    Laptop Screen Inverters and Display components: Powers backlight in older LCD screens, Converts DC power to AC for cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) but LED screens no longer need inverters. <br>
                    Wireless Antennas: Laptops almost always have wi-fi, bluetooth, sometimes has Cellular. You can buy external antennas. <br>
                    Common problems and fixes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Webcam not detected: check drivers, enable camera settings.</li>
                        <li>Microphone not working: adjust input levels, reinstall drivers.</li>
                        <li>Weak Wi-Fi signal: update network drivers, adjust router placement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Best practices for maintenance: clean everything regularly, keep drivers updated, ensure privacy settings allow access to integrated peripherals. 
                </p>

                <h4>Digitizers</h4>
                <p>Digitizers conver analog touch or pen input into digital signals. The are found in touchscreens, drawing tablets and stylus supported devices. <br>
                Capacitive touchscreens: use a layer of conductive material that reacts to touch. They support multi touch gestures. Have a high responsiveness and accuracy compared to resistive screens. <br>
                Resistive touchscreens: use multiple layers that respond to physical pressure. Supports only single touch input. These are common in ATMS, industrial equipment, and 
                older phones. But they are a bit more rugged and work well in extreme environments. Work with any object, and are more cost effective. <br>
                Styluses: Active styluses contain internal electronics for pressure sensitivity, passive stylus are like a finger, and EMR stylus use elecromagnetic resonance for percision work. <br>
                Common issues: Unresponsive screen (fix: restart device, clean screen, update drivers, recalibrate), ghost touches (fix: recalibrate touchscreen, check for damage), stylus not recognized 
                (fix: check battery of stylus, update firmware), delayed response (fix: could be overheating or driver issue). <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Docking stations and Port Replicators</h4>
                <p>Docking station: provides additional ports, power deliver and extended functionality. <br>
                    Port replicator: A spmplified version of a docking station that extends port availibility. <br>
                    Key features of docking stations: multiple USB ports, video output ports, ethernet ports, audio ports, and power deliver. <br>
                    Benefits of using these: Increase productivitiy, enhanced workstation experience, simplified connectivity, supports high speed data transfer. <br>
                    How to choose: Consider device compatibility, port requirements, power delivery needs, video output capability, budget vs features. <br>
                    Troubleshooting: Device not recognized (check if connected properly, and is powered, check for driver updates and firmware compatibility) 
                    , no video output (check settings in display config, check connection), USB devices not working (make sure they have enough power), no network 
                    (check cable connection and settings). <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Safe handling of computer components</h4>
                <p>Don't shock things!!! Use anti-static wrist straps and anti-static mats. Ground yourself first. Store and transport components in antistatic bags. <br>
                    Hold motherboards by edges and don't touch the circuits and pins. Handle CPU by sides. Ram modules should be fully inserted but not with excessive force. 
                    Hard Drives and SSDs should not be dropped or have weird pressure applied. <br>
                    Always unplug power sources, use power supply tester to check it works, and make sure your hands are dry. <br>
                    For cable managment it is good to keep them organized to avoid strain and improve airflow. Use cable ties or velcro. And make sure power cables are properly grounded. <br>
                    Work on a clean flat surface, avoid placing heavy things on delicate things, ensure components are properly seated, maintain optimal room temperature, avoid excessive humidity, and 
                    keep food and drink away. <br>
                    Common mistakes: Forgetting to ground yourself, handling things roughly, forcing parts into place, ignoring cooling considerations. <br>
                    Best practices: Double-check orientation before insertion, follow manufacturer guidelines, keep spare screws in LABELED CONTAINERS. <br>
                </p>

                </p>

                <h4>Cleaning hardware components</h4>
                <p>This helps prevent overheating and improving airflow, which will reduce risk of failure, and keep the system reliable. <br>
                    Tools: Compressed Air, Microfiber cloth, Isopropyl alcohol, anti-static brush, vacuum cleaner (ESD safe). <br>
                    Cleaning exterior and peripherals: Keyboard and mouse, Display, vents, computer case. <br>
                    Internal components: use compressed air to remove dust buildup, RAM modules and slots use anti-static brush, and clean PSU with compressed air (they sometimes have openable panels but BE CAREFUL) <br>
                    Precautions: Power off and unplug PC, avoid excessive air pressure. <br>
                    Cleaning an dreplacing thermal paste: Remove old thermal paste using isopropyl alcohol and lint free cloth, then reapply, monitor the CPU temperatures to ensure proper application. <br>
                    Cleaning Printers and other Peripherals: Follow manufacturer guidelines, and use compresesed air to get rid of dust. There are usually internal process to clean the print heads. <br>
                    Dust is the biggest enemy!! Keep things dust free! <br>
                    Best practices for long-term maintenance: Clean external components weekly, Perform internal dust removal every 3-6 months, Replace themal paste every 1-2 year, check and clean printers monthly, 
                    keep workstations dust-free, work in cool dry environment, and use dust filters on PC cases. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Common causes of hardware failure</h4>
                <p>Wear and tear over time, Electrical or enviromental damage, Manufacturing defects. <br>
                    Mechancial failures: Moving parts will wear out (HDDS, Fans, etc), physical damage, improper instillation. <br>
                    Reducing Risk of Mechanical Failures: Switch to SSDs, be careful lol, regularly check for loose cables and connections. <br>
                    Causes of Electrical Failures: Power surges, Overheating, short circuits. <br>
                    Reducing risk of Electrical failures: Surge protectors and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), Maintain proper airflow and cleaning, keep liquids away. <br>
                    Environmental Causes: Extreme temps, Humidity, Dust and Debris. <br>
                    Reducing Environmental Risks: Keep the system in a good climate controlled environment and clean dust. <br>
                    Manufacturing defects and software related failures: For hardware there isn't much we can do to prevent it but we can detect it. If there is a software induced failure it is 
                    likely that a monitoring application function is not working properly. This is pretty rare though. <br>
                    Best practices for hardware longevity: Regular backups, Monitor system temperatures, replace aging components, keep system updated.
                </p>

                </p>

                <h4>Serial Communication</h4>
                <p>Method of transmitting data one bit at a time over a single channel or wire. USB really took over but this used to be essential for connecting industrial devices and such. 
                    But it is still around, you can find it in POS systems, networking hardware, and medical devices. <br>
                    RS-232 Standard: This is one of the earliest serial communication standards. Voltage based signaling. Speed is a "baud rate" and was 300 to 115,200 bps (bits per second). 
                    Could travel about 50 ft without repeaters. The connectors are called DB-9 and DB-25. Were replaced iwht USB-to-serial converters. <br>
                    RS-422 and RS-485 Standards: These are improved versions of RS-232. Less noisy and improved data integrity. RS-422 supports speed up to 10 Mbps over 1,200 meters. It's common in industrial automation, 
                    telecom systems, and point to point communications. RS-485 extends RS-422 with multi-point capability, allowing multiple devices on the same bus. It's used in SCADA systems, HVAC control, and 
                    factory automation. <br>
                    USB-to-Serial Conversion: Most computers don't have serial ports. You would need an adapter. Modern devices don't tend to have these interfaces. You would need to match the converter to the standard. <br>
                    Modern alts to Serial COmmunication: Ethernet based communications, wireless, and CAN bus (controller area network) which is a vehicle bus standard. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Bluetooth</h4>
                <p>Pairing bluetooth devices creates a unique link key that is stored on both devices which allows for easy reconnection. <br>
                    Pairing bluetooth devices: Ensure bluetooth is enbaled on both devices, set accessory into pairing mode, Search for available devices on mobile device, select correct device on list, comfirm pairing request, 
                    connection established and stored. <br>
                    Common problems; Device not found, Repeated disconnections, Pin mismatch, Interference from other wireless signals. <br>
                    Troubleshooting: Restart both devices, ensure range is good, Clear paired device history, disable wi-fi or interference sources. <br>
                    Security risks: "bluejacking" sending unsolicited messages, "bluesnarfing": unauthorized access to device data, "Man in the middle attacks" someone is intercepting the communications. <br>
                    Safety best practices: Keep bluetooth off when not using, use SSP (secure simple pairing) and avoid legacy PIN-based pairing, regularly clear old paired devices, regularly update firmware. <br>
                    Differences between bluetooth versions: Bluetooth 4.0 10m 1Mbps Moderate power and basic security, 5.0 40m 2Mbps High power efficiency Improved encryption, 5.4 60m 2Mbps with LE audio and improved stability very high power efficiency and enhanced encryption and periodic advertising. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>NFC (Near Field Communication)</h4>
                <p>Short ranged wireless technology that allowes two devices to exchange data when 1.5 in appart. Used for tap to pay, data transfer, ect. It operates at 13.56 MHz (RFID) data transfer rates of 106, 212, and 424 kbps 
                    (this is slow but usually data mount is small anyway). Has 3 different modes, peer-to-peer, reader/writer, and card emulation. <br>
                    Typical applications: Contactless payments, Smart access control, Device pairing, Retail and marketing. <br>
                    How it works: Initiator (active device) sends out and EMI field and the target (passive device or tag) picks up on that EMI and then data is transferred. <br>
                    It is very conveniet, secure, and low power consumption. <br>
                    Security risks: Eavesdropping , Data corruption, Relay attacks. 
                    Safety best practices: Enable secure NFC mode, use tokenization in payments, Routinely update NFC apps and firmway. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Mobile Application Connectivity</h4>

                    Common problems: Internet connection problems, App specific issues, Device specific issues. <br>
                    Troubleshooting: Verify network settings, Check application permissions and settings, Clear the cache and update the app <br>
                    Preventative measures: Keep app and OS updated, monitor network connectivity, Use reliable networks and settings. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Updating Mobile Devices</h4>
                <p>There can be major or minor updates. There can be System or OS updates, Security updates, and App updates. <br>
                    You can always check for updates. <br>
                    Common issues: Insufficient storage, battery drain while updating, update might fail to install. <br>
                    Best practices: Enable automatic updates, Regularaly check for updates, Use Wi-Fi for updates, Keep app updates enabled. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Mobile Security</h4>
                <p>Common threats: Phishing attacks, Malware, unauthorized network access, and data interception. <br>
                    Malware is a bit less common in mobile devices because usually you can only install apps from the app store. <br>
                    best practices: Enforce strong authentications, Keep software and apps updated, enable remote lock and wipe. <br>
                    Securing Mobile Networks and Connections: Use encrypted communications, use Secure Wi-Fi, use a VPN to ensure all communications are encrypted. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Wired vs Wireless Features</h4>
                <p>I like wired because it's faster and more stable. Sometimes phone cases can block wireless charging. Wired is also more efficient power wise. 
                    Fast wired charging also is hard on the battery. 
                </p>

                <h4>Managing battery life</h4>
                <p>
                    Lifespan is in charge cycles typically 300-500 cycles. Heat overcharging and deep discharging negatively impact battery health. Battery health features are helpful. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Wireless and Cellular Data</h4>
                <p>
                    Wi-Fi transmit using radio frequencies (2.4 Ghz 5 Ghz, 6 Ghz). Wi-Fi 6 and 6E improve speed, efficiency and reduce congestion. Wi-Fi 7 offers better speeds, lower lateency, and greater capacity. 
                    Wi-Fi 8 is anticipated to be availible in 2028. <br>
                    Cellular Networks are provided via the different generations, 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G. LTE stands for Long term evolution which is a specific standard in the 4G scope. 5G-Advanced (5.5G) is a bit more advanced with 
                    better performance, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and expanded functionality. <br>
                    Wi-Fi vs Cellular: Wi-Fi is tied to a router while Cell is nationwid/global, Wi-Fi is faster, Wi-Fi is lower latency, Wi-Fi is usually a fixed price while cell needs a data plan, and Wi-Fi has limited mobility. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Location Services</h4>
                <p>
                    This is for navigation, location-based apps, or geofencing. How it works: GPS, WPS (Wi_Fi Positioning System), Cellular triangulation. <br>
                    Privacy Concerns: Location data is being collected, there are privacy settings and permissions in apps, You can also use Secure location services (like using a VPN connection). <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Mobile Device Managment (MDM)</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a service that allows IT admins to remotely manage, monitor, and secure mobile devices across an organization. It helps ensure compliance, data protection, and centralized control over device configs. 
                    This is used in corporate, education, and gov environments to enforce security policies. This provides remote control, app management, and security enforcement for enrolled devices. Usually this means that the 
                    organization is providing the mobile device but that is not always the case. <br>
                    How it works: First the device is enrolled into the MDM system. Then it recieves it's configuration, thus it is setup automatically. Then it can be remotely monitored and managed. <br>
                    Examples of configs: Automating Wi-Fi configuration. Enforce secure Wi-Fi policies. Manage network usage (data limits, bandwidth limits). Security can also be configured. The device could be encrypted. 
                    Restric which apps can be installed. Monitor for compliancy. <br>
                    Overall the idea is to allow admin to be able to control the device.
                </p>

                <h4>Bring your own device (BYOD)</h4>
                <p>
                    Use your own device. This is what I use. But it can create security concerns. <br>
                    Benefits: Cheaper because the company doesn't have to puchase the devices. Increases Productivity and employees are happier using their own device. <br>
                    Challenges: Security risks. Compliance concerns. Devic management complexity. <br>
                    Implementing a scure byod policy: Device entrollment and authentication, there are security and compliance measures but they will be more limited, network and access control. <br>
                    Employees often store private data on the devices and malware and phishing attacks are more common. It's also harder to deal with a stolen or lost device. <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Mobile device synchronization methods</h4>
                <p>
                    Cloud-based synch where data is stored in the cloud. Local synch where devices can talk directly to each other. App specific sychs where only data from a specific app is synched. <br>
                    Was to configure: Use cloud sync like icloud or use third party syncing apps like google drive or dropbox. <br>
                    Security considerations: Data encryption end to end, manage sync permissions, and make sure data is backed up in clase of data conflict or loss. Sometimes you can assign priorities to different versions in different places <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Mobile Performance Optimization</h4>
                <p>
                    Mobile devices slow down over time due to app bloat, background process, and hardware limitations. <br>
                    Managing apps and background processes: CLOSE UNUSED APPS, Limit background app activity like auto refresh. Monitor app performance like see what is consuming the most power. <br>
                    Storage and Memory Optimization: Free up storage space, optimize RAM usage. Manage system cache and junk files.
