                <p id="intro">Some Goals of mine for 2026</p>
            </header>

            <h2>MAIN GOAL: Have a stable secure life</h2>
            <p>To do this I need to have a solid career, this means have an "AI proof" job. This means the most necessary and desired skill is dealing with people oh god. 
                I think I will build on the technical skills I have but try to put more focus on my soft skill T~T oh god. <br>
                Anyway here's a list of things that might work towards this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve soft skills</li>
                <li>Diversify Income</li>
                <li>Manage my spending better</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SUB GOAL 1: Fix my social awkwardness</h2>
            <p>
                Approach is maybe to keep a journal with daily tasks as well as a "Parking lot" section to keep tracks of the people I know. I think that maybe this should be a physical notebook. <br>
                Some tasks to work on this:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>At the end of the day, write about 3 interactions that happened and answer the following questions. 1) What did I feel? 2) What caused the feeling? 3) How did I respond?</li>
                <li>If an especially difficult interaction happened. Journal about it and try and analyze how I sounded.</li>
                <li>Add three check boxes for open-ended questions. These could be about Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams (F-O-R-D Method), be a situation tie in, or a follow up.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ideally the last point will be getting recorded in the "Parking Lot". <br>
            Here are some tips for being better at remembering people and networking.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use 3x Rule for names. Say name as soon as you hear it.</li>
                <li>Say it again in the conversation</li>
                <li>Say it after leaving the coversation and add one key detail. Record this in the Parking Lot</li>
                <li>In parking lot record: Name & Date met</li>
                <li>Where/Context</li>
                <li>1 Personal Detail</li>
                <li>1 Potential Follow-Up Topic</li>
                <li>Add a reminder in the reminder queue in my planner, for Core Coworkers follow up weekly, for General Coworkers follow up every 4-8 weeks, and for my extended network follow up every 3-6 months.</li>
                <li>With a new entry I should follow up within 1-2 weeks</li>
                <li>When the follow-up window opens start researching a way to have a value-driven check in. This could be shared value (industry article, book, or video). A congratulation on something. Or asking for advice or feedback.</li>
                <li>To open an interaction use a common ground such as the immediate environment, asking for help, or give a sincere compliment.</li>
            </ul>
